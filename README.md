Hi, my name is Luke Venkataramanan. I am a young programmer from Katy, Texas, and I attend Obra D. Tompkins High School, where I will graduate from in the spring of 2022.

This GitHub is a place where I can share some of my coding projects, as well as collaborate with fellow programmers.

Feel free to look around. 
If you have any questions, please contact me at luke.venkataramanan@gmail.com.

Enjoy your stay!
